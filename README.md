# Bioadata App With Redux Hooks

# React Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. <br/>
React Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux.
For more information, you can check [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

## Description

This program is built by implementing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) system using React Redux technology. To simplify the project, I used a fake REST API that contains student data. You can find the instructions for creating the fake REST API [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). For easier styling, I used the Chakra-UI component-based library and the Tailwind CSS framework.

## What i learned

What I learned from working on this project is how to use Redux as a state management solution. The concept of Redux is designed to simplify the management of complex states. Instead of the complexity of passing a state to an intermediary component, it's better to use Redux as the state management.

I learned a lot in this project, such as the usage of Hooks like useSelector, useDispatch, and others. I also learned how the data flow works in Redux, and you can see the Redux flow on the official Redux website [here](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/01cc198232551a7e180f4e9e327b5ab22d9d14e7/b33f4/assets/images/reduxdataflowdiagram-49fa8c3968371d9ef6f2a1486bd40a26.gif). Most importantly, this project significantly enhanced my React skills..
